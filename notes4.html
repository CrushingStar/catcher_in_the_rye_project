            <p>
            A lot has happened recently. I was pretty lost, you know, seriously considered ending everything. (I mean, I can't feel lonely if I don't exist, right?)
            </p>
            <p>
            For the past several weeks, I've tried reach out to whoever I can—my old friends, teachers, whoever. (There is more detail to the story—more ups and downs—but I'd rather not leave it as a record here.) Meeting them face-to-face surely was an experience; some encounters were awkward, and frankly, some didn't seem to care much about what I had to say. Not much different from social media, I guess. But, a few were unexpectedly refreshing. We talked for hours, and for the first time in a while, it felt genuine. Real conversations, genuine laughter and reactions—no emojis or filters, just raw human interaction. People who listened, not just heard. Their willingness to listen meant the world to me.
            </p>

            I dunno, these in-person encounters kinda saved me, at least for now. It made me realize that perhaps, just maybe, there's still a chance for authentic connections in this world. I'm starting to believe that I don't need those flashy profiles or hollow conversations behind screens; what I need are real people and real moments. Breaking free from this virtual world.
            </p>

            And apparently, this isolation issue from social media isn't just my problem. I've googled and found that many people feel the same way. It's like this whole virtual world is suffocating us. I dunno, I guess it's kinda reassuring knowing I'm not alone in navigating this suffocating digital world.
            </p>
            <p>
            Anyway, it might be time to dial back on social media. I mean, seriously, scrolling through all that nonsense isn't doing me any favors. And about the drinking thing, yeah, I'm thinking it's not doing me any favors either. Maybe it's time to hit pause on that too. It's like a step towards finding my own vibe—I'm just ready to swap the screen time for something more real.
