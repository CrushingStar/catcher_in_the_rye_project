            <p>I need to vent a bit. There's a lot swirling inside me, but it feels like no one's around to listen. So, I'm jotting it down here in my notes.</p>

            <p>I'm not one for pouring out my guts like this, but I gotta admit, this whole thing with social media makes me sick to my stomach. It's like everyone's putting on this phony show, acting like they're rockstars or something. All that boasting and flaunting, making their lives seem picture-perfect—it's just a load of nonsense.</p>

            <p>Like Insta, for example. It irks me. Everyone be flashing their cash, relationships, network, appearance—whatever they can flaunt—like they're living in some glossy magazine. The captions sound like they're written by a six-year-old. It's all so artificial and cringe and disheartening, like they're playing some kinda roles instead of living real lives. The world I'm in feels downright depressing.</p>

            <p>I don't know, maybe I can't change much about it. Maybe I'm just being a social reject.</p>

            <p>I thought of grabbing some whiskey and finding company this week—some kind of remedy for this soulless virtual world.</p>
