            <p>I can't handle this anymore. It feels like I'm drowning in a sea of fake connections plastered all over these screens. I'm falling apart. That suffocating feeling of being utterly alone, despite scrolling past countless people, is overwhelming.</p>

<p>I had another drink, hoping it would numb the pain, drown out the shallowness. But it just made things worse. My head spun, and everything blurred, yet the loneliness felt sharp as a knife.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I tried meeting a girl—Lana or something from Tinder. Got all dressed up and ready, then suddenly felt scared, like stepping into a world I didn't want to be part of. I ended up bailing—meaning I'm still a virgin—but whatever. I can lose it whenever.</p>

<p>Social media's really messing me up. The shallow distractions, the endless chatting, judging, ghosting—it's driving me nuts. Each interaction feels like a desperate attempt to fill a void I can't define. I talk to people, hoping for a connection that never arrives.</p>

<p>The more I try, the more disconnected I become. It's eating away at me. I'm tired of pretending everything's fine, pretending I'm not sinking deeper into this emptiness. I feel unbearably lonely. Help. Please help.</p>
